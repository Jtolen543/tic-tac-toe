            <div class="description">Super or Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is an advanced version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, played on a 9x9 grid divided into nine smaller 3x3 grids. Players compete to win these mini-boards by getting three in a row, with the twist that each move determines where the opponent must play next. The ultimate goal is to win three mini-boards in a row on the larger grid, adding a significant layer of strategy and foresight to the game. If a mini-board is already won or full, players can choose their next move on any remaining board.</div>
